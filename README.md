# warn-tweeter-mass


A now defunct project that tweeted Massachusetts WARN (https://www.mass.gov/info-details/worker-adjustment-and-retraining-act-warn-weekly-report) notices to Twitter.
The app was killed by Twitter.

It's function was to tweet information about which companies would soon do a large round of layoffs, to give folks an advance notice of the potential to lose their job.
